    <p> Guys, welcome to your normal IT&C 101 class, it's ya boi Dr. Hansen. We're gonna start off this class with my
        favorite language, HTML, and then move into my favorite youtube video, and close off this class with a

    <h1> Abstract</h1>
    <p> Today class we'll talk about <em>HTML</em>. Now, what is HTML? Some would call it Hyper Text Markup Language.
        But me, Professor Hansen, would call it Heckin Tubular Markup Language, haha. Now, for your lab, you'll be
        creating <strong>YOUR OWN WEBSITE</strong> using this Heckin Tubular Markup Language. Okay good luck.</p>

<p> Okay classy class if you have never had gravy from turkey parts and homemade chicken stock before, take all the
    extra turkey bones home tonight and MAKE SOME.
    It is one of the most heavenly elixirs I have ever had. My soul ascended to a warm, earth-toned heaven. A rose of
    warmth and hope filled my chest. I thought in than moment, I saw the patron saint of Thanksgiving, St. Corn Cob,
    this year's presidential turkey. Simply transcendent.</p>
